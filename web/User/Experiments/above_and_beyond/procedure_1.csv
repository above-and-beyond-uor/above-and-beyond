This framework has been adopted from the 'Learning from Excellence' programme used in the NHS. Whether it is a small undertaking or a large-scale project, this is a simple way of acknowledging colleagues' efforts. It is a quick and easy form to complete and your nominee will receive a great big thank you and a warm fuzzy feeling inside.
